        <h4>Pizza</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Cornmeal (to help slide the pizza onto the pizza stone)</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce (smooth or pureed)</li>
            <li>Firm mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
            <li>Fresh soft mozzarella cheese, separated into small clumps</li>
            <li>Any other toppings you want!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Making the pizza dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the warm water in the large bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes until the yeast is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, salt, sugar, and olive oil, and using the mixing paddle attachment, mix on low speed for a minute. Then replace the mixing paddle with the dough hook attachment.
                Knead the pizza dough on low to medium speed using the dough hook about 7-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Preparing the pizzas</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pizza stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven. Preheat the oven to 475°F for at least 30 minutes, preferably an hour.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic cover from the dough. Dust your hands with flour and push the dough down so it deflates a bit. Divide the dough in half.
                Form two round balls of dough. Place each in its own bowl, cover with plastic and let sit for 15 minutes (or up to 2 hours)</li>
            <li>Prepare your desired toppings. About a third a cup each of tomato sauce and cheese would be sufficient for one pizza. One to two mushrooms thinly sliced will cover a pizza.</li>
            <li>Working one ball of dough at a time, take one ball of dough and flatten it with your hands on a lightly floured work surface.</li>
            <li>Brush the dough top with olive oil</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top</li>
            <li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the cornmeal on pizza stone, slide pizza onto pizza stone in oven</li>
            <li>Bake</li>
        </ol>
