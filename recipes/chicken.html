            <li>1 cup tempura batter mix, or as needed</li>
            <li>peanut oil for frying</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine chicken pieces, soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, five-spice powder, white pepper, salt, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Let marinate for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 400 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl until smooth. Pour tempura batter mix into a second small bowl.

                Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until chicken is golden brown, 5 to 8 minutes.
